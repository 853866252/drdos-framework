# Drdos Framework

Drdos Framework is my outcome of drdos working. I try to write this like a real framework.

## Declaration

**This tool is for learning only. Not for illegal use.**

## Prepare

1. Linux server
2. Golang env

## Usage

1. `go get github.com/google/gopacket`
2. Just run `go run main.go --help`

`[*] Attention : In check mode and mix mode, -f in /data/loadfile/, -o in /data/results/. But in attack mode, -f in /data/results/. You know, just for convenience`

### Some help

`--type` should be one of `dns`,`mem`,`ntp`,`snmp`,`ssdp`,`portmap`,`ldap`
`-f` must in `/data/loadfile/`
`-o` the outputfile is saved in `/data/results/`

## Q&A

Q: How much flow can this do?
A: It depends on how many source ip you get, and the type of attack. Memcached nearly 200 times, ntp 10~15 times, ssdp 10 times, dns 5 times...

## Intruduction

Drdos Framework can check the vulner of drdos iplist. Also it's got the attack mode to start drdos attack.

## Protocol Supported

|Port|Protocol|
|:-:|:-:|
|53|dns|
|111|portmap|
|123|ntp|
|161|snmp|
|389|ldap|
|1900|ssdp|
|11211|memcache|

## Update plan

It will be deleted once I achieve

1. HTTP API
2. SHODAN | FOFA API
3. ~~Blacklist of attack~~
4. Improve response check
5. Support more protocol
6. Use sqlite to save data
